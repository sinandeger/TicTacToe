# TicTacToe
A simple machine learning algorithm that will hopefully some day soon learn to play tic-tac-toe


This project, decidedly still under construction, will employ a simple machine learning algorithm that will learn how to play tic-tac-toe. For now, the multiplayer game is functional, and allows for playing the game against an opponent.
